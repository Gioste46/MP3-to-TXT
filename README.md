# MP3-to-TXT
This project provides a tool for converting MP3 audio files into text transcriptions using Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition API. Built with Python, it is designed to handle large audio files by breaking them into manageable chunks and processing each chunk in parallel, improving both efficiency and performance.
